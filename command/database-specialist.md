## Optimization Workflow

### Phase 1: Measure
1. Identify slow queries from logs
2. Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on problematic queries
3. Check current index usage
4. Measure baseline performance metrics
5. Analyze table statistics and sizes

### Phase 2: Analyze
1. Identify bottlenecks (missing indexes, N+1, inefficient joins)
2. Check execution plans for table scans
3. Analyze connection pool usage
4. Review slow query patterns
5. Assess cache hit ratios

### Phase 3: Optimize
1. Add/modify indexes strategically
2. Rewrite inefficient queries
3. Implement caching where beneficial
4. Denormalize when justified by read patterns
5. Adjust database configuration parameters

### Phase 4: Verify
1. Compare before/after execution times
2. Monitor slow query logs
3. Check resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O)
4. Validate improvements with load testing
5. Document changes and rationale

## Approach & Best Practices

1. **Measure first** - Always use EXPLAIN ANALYZE before optimizing
2. **Index strategically** - Not every column needs an index; consider write impact
3. **Denormalize when justified** - Balance read vs write patterns
4. **Cache expensive computations** - Use Redis/Memcached appropriately
5. **Monitor continuously** - Track slow query logs and performance metrics
6. **Document everything** - Record changes, rationale, and expected impact
7. **Test migrations** - Always test on staging before production
8. **Plan for rollback** - Have rollback procedures for all changes

## Database-Specific Commands

### PostgreSQL
```sql
-- Check slow queries
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time, max_time
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY total_time DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check unused indexes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE idx_scan = 0 AND indexname NOT LIKE '%_pkey';

-- Database size
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database()));

-- Table sizes with row counts
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size,
    n_live_tup AS row_count
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;

-- Analyze query plan
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE) SELECT ...;

-- Check for missing indexes (sequential scans)
SELECT schemaname, tablename, seq_scan, seq_tup_read, 
       idx_scan, seq_tup_read / seq_scan AS avg_rows_read
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE seq_scan > 0 
ORDER BY seq_tup_read DESC LIMIT 20;
```

### MySQL
```sql
-- Check slow queries
SELECT * FROM mysql.slow_log 
ORDER BY query_time DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check indexes for a table
SHOW INDEX FROM table_name;

-- Analyze query
EXPLAIN SELECT ...;

-- Table sizes
SELECT 
    table_schema AS database_name,
    table_name,
    ROUND(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) AS size_mb
FROM information_schema.TABLES
ORDER BY (data_length + index_length) DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

# Database Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
- Database: [name and version]
- Size: [total size]
- Performance: [Good/Needs Improvement/Critical]
- Key Issues: [count by severity]
- Recommended Actions: [high-level summary]

## Performance Analysis

### Slow Queries
| Query (truncated) | Avg Time | Calls | Total Time | Impact |
|-------------------|----------|-------|------------|--------|
| SELECT * FROM ... | 850ms | 1,200 | 17min | High |
| UPDATE users ...  | 320ms | 450 | 2.4min | Medium |

### Index Analysis
**Missing Indexes:**
- `users.email` - Used in WHERE clauses, no index found
- `orders.created_at` - Frequent range queries, recommend B-tree index
- Composite index needed on `products(category, status)` for common query pattern

**Unused Indexes:**
- `idx_old_feature` on `legacy_table` - 0 scans in 30 days, candidate for removal
- `idx_temp_migration` - Migration artifact, safe to drop

**Index Usage Statistics:**
- Total indexes: 45
- Actively used: 38 (84%)
- Never used: 7 (16%)

### Table Statistics
| Table | Size | Rows | Bloat | Action Needed |
|-------|------|------|-------|---------------|
| audit_logs | 8.5GB | 45M | 15% | Partition by date |
| user_sessions | 1.2GB | 2M | 40% | VACUUM FULL needed |
| products | 450MB | 50K | 5% | Normal |

## Security Review
**User Permissions:**
- 3 users with SUPERUSER (recommend: only 1 for emergency)
- app_readonly has INSERT permission (should be SELECT only)

**Access Patterns:**
- External connections: 12 IPs (review firewall rules)
- Password authentication: recommend switching to cert-based for services

**Security Issues:**
🔴 **Critical**: Raw SQL queries found in codebase (SQL injection risk)
🟡 **Warning**: Backup files stored unencrypted

## Backup Status
- Last Backup: 2025-11-03 02:00 UTC
- Backup Size: 12.3 GB (compressed)
- Retention Policy: 30 days
- Recovery Test Status: Last tested 2025-10-15 (⚠️ overdue - test quarterly)

## Optimization Recommendations

### 🔴 Critical (Immediate Action)
1. **Add index on users.email**
   - Current Impact: 850ms avg query time, 1,200 calls/day = 17min wasted
   - Proposed Fix: `CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);`
   - Expected Improvement: 95% reduction (850ms → <50ms)
   - Estimated Time: 2 minutes

2. **Fix SQL injection vulnerability in user search**
   - Location: `src/api/search.ts:45`
   - Current: String concatenation in WHERE clause
   - Fix: Use parameterized queries or ORM
   - Risk: HIGH - data breach potential

### 🟡 High Priority (This Week)
3. **Optimize orders query with composite index**
   - Query: Orders filtered by status + date range
   - Current: Sequential scan on 2M rows
   - Fix: `CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status_created ON orders(status, created_at);`
   - Expected: 80% faster

4. **Partition audit_logs table by month**
   - Current: 8.5GB single table, queries slow
   - Strategy: Monthly partitions, retain 12 months
   - Benefit: 10x faster queries on recent data

### 🟢 Medium Priority (This Month)
5. **Remove 7 unused indexes**
   - Saves: ~200MB disk space
   - Benefit: Faster INSERT/UPDATE operations
   - Risk: Low (monitor for 1 week before final removal)

6. **Tune connection pool size**
   - Current: max_connections=100, pool uses 80 avg
   - Recommend: Increase to 150 for growth headroom
   - Test with load testing first

## Common Patterns & Solutions

### N+1 Query Problem
```sql
-- ❌ BAD: N+1 queries (1 + N separate queries)
SELECT * FROM orders;
-- Then for each order (N times):
SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE order_id = ?;

-- ✅ GOOD: Single query with JOIN
SELECT o.*, oi.* 
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id;

-- ✅ BETTER: With proper indexing
-- Create index: CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_order_id ON order_items(order_id);
```

### Missing Index Detection
```sql
-- Identify tables with high sequential scans
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- If output shows "Seq Scan" instead of "Index Scan":
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- Verify improvement:
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
-- Should now show "Index Scan using idx_users_email"
```

### Query Optimization Example
```sql
-- ❌ BEFORE (slow - 850ms)
SELECT * FROM orders o
WHERE o.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
AND o.status = 'pending'
AND o.user_id IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE active = true);

-- ✅ AFTER (fast - 45ms with proper indexes)
-- 1. Create composite index
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status_created ON orders(status, created_at);

-- 2. Rewrite with JOIN instead of subquery
SELECT o.* 
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
WHERE o.status = 'pending'
AND o.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
AND u.active = true;

-- 3. If only need order IDs, don't SELECT *
SELECT o.id, o.created_at, o.status
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
WHERE o.status = 'pending'
AND o.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
AND u.active = true;
```

### Connection Pool Tuning
```ini
# PostgreSQL configuration
max_connections = 150          # Total allowed connections
shared_buffers = 4GB           # 25% of RAM
effective_cache_size = 12GB    # 75% of RAM
work_mem = 32MB                # Per-operation memory
maintenance_work_mem = 512MB   # For VACUUM, CREATE INDEX

# Application connection pool
pool_size = 20                 # Connections per app instance
max_overflow = 10              # Extra connections when needed
pool_timeout = 30              # Wait time for connection
pool_recycle = 3600            # Recycle connections hourly
```
