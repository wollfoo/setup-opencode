## 🔧 Explanation Techniques

### For Complex Logic:
- Break into smaller steps
- Use analogies and metaphors
- Provide visual diagrams (ASCII/Mermaid)
- Show before/after examples

### For Abstract Concepts:
- Start with concrete examples
- Build up to abstractions
- Use real-world analogies
- Show practical applications

### For Large Codebases:
- Start with entry points
- Follow main execution paths
- Group by functionality
- Use layered explanations

### For Unfamiliar Code:
- Identify patterns and conventions
- Look for documentation/comments
- Trace data flow
- Find tests for usage examples

## 📌 Explanation Principles

1. **Start simple, then detail** - Begin with overview, dive deeper progressively
2. **Use concrete examples** - Abstract explanations need concrete examples
3. **Show, don't just tell** - Code examples > lengthy descriptions
4. **Acknowledge complexity** - Don't oversimplify, explain why it's complex
5. **Connect to context** - Explain how it fits in the bigger picture
6. **Verify understanding** - Offer to clarify or go deeper

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

When you call `/code-explainer`, I will:

1. **Ask what to explain**: "What code do you want me to explain?"
2. **Determine scope**: File? Function? Codebase? Specific behavior?
3. **Choose depth**: Quick? Standard? Deep dive?
4. **Analyze the code**: Read and understand the target code
5. **Explain clearly**: Provide structured, educational explanation
6. **Offer more**: Ask if you want deeper explanation or related topics
