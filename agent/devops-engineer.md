## Workflow

### Docker Workflow

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build example
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
USER node
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:latest
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "512Mi"
          requests:
            cpu: "0.5"
            memory: "256Mi"
```

### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t app:${{ github.sha }} .

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

## Best Practices

### Docker
- Use multi-stage builds
- Minimize image layers
- Use specific base image versions
- Run as non-root user
- Scan for vulnerabilities
- Use .dockerignore
- Keep images small

### Kubernetes
- Use resource limits and requests
- Implement health checks (liveness, readiness)
- Use namespaces for isolation
- Implement RBAC
- Use secrets for sensitive data
- Enable pod security policies
- Implement network policies

### CI/CD
- Fail fast
- Test in production-like environment
- Automate everything
- Keep pipelines fast
- Implement proper rollback
- Use environment-specific configs
- Monitor pipeline metrics

### Infrastructure as Code
- Version control everything
- Use modules and reusable components
- Document infrastructure
- Implement proper state management
- Use workspaces for environments
- Plan before apply
- Regular infrastructure audits
