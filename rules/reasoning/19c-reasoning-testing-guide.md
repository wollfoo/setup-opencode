# 19c. Reasoning Testing Guide

## 📋 Overview

**Testing Guide** (hướng dẫn kiểm thử) defines **test scenarios** (kịch bản test), **validation criteria** (tiêu chí kiểm định), và **success metrics** (chỉ số thành công) cho Escalation & Verification Series.

**Philosophy**: "Test Early, Test Often" — Mỗi component đều có test suite

## Unit Test Scenarios

### 1. Complexity Scoring Tests

```yaml

  test_simple_query:
    input: "What is 2+2?"
    expected_score: 0.0
    expected_layer: 1
    assertion: "score == 0.0"
  
  test_comparison_query:
    input: "React or Vue?"
    expected_score: 2.0  # +2 for 'or'
    expected_layer: 2
    assertion: "score >= 2.0 and score < 3.0"
  
  test_complex_architectural:
    input: "Compare microservices vs monolith for scalability"
    expected_score: 8.0  # +2 compare, +2 vs, +2 architecture, +2 scalability
    expected_layer: 3
    assertion: "score >= 7.0"
  
  test_max_complexity:
    input: "Should we compare microservices vs monolith architecture for our long-term scalability strategy if we might need performance optimization?"

## Known Issues & Limitations

```yaml
Known_Limitations:
  
  complexity_scoring:
    - "May misclassify domain-specific jargon"
    - "Word count bonus can over-inflate simple verbose queries"
    - "Mitigation: Manual threshold tuning per domain"
  
  trigger_detection:
    - "Financial threshold hard-coded at $100K"
    - "May not detect implicit high-stakes"
    - "Mitigation: Allow custom threshold configuration"
  
  lateral_pass:
    - "Alternative generation limited to 3-5 options"
    - "May miss creative solutions"
    - "Mitigation: User can suggest additional alternatives"
  
  performance:
    - "Layer 4 can exceed 120s on complex queries"
    - "Layer 5 can timeout on large formal proofs"
    - "Mitigation: Async processing + progress updates"
```
